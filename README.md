# **Shopping List App â€“ Demonstrating Advanced Jetpack Compose UI & State Management**  

This project showcases my **proficiency in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose**, featuring an **interactive shopping list application** with a clean, modern UI. It highlights **state management, input validation, UI architecture, and Material 3 integration**, demonstrating my ability to **build scalable and user-friendly Android applications**.  

## **Key Technical Highlights**  

### **Modern UI with Jetpack Compose & Material 3**  
- Designed a **dynamic and responsive shopping list UI**, following **Material 3 design principles** to ensure consistency, accessibility, and usability.  
- Utilized **custom composables** like `AlertDialogComposable`, enhancing UI modularity and reusability.  
- Integrated **Material 3 components**, including `OutlinedTextField`, `AlertDialog`, and `SmallFloatingActionButton`, to maintain a seamless and modern UX.  

### **State Management & Data Handling**  
- Implemented **Composeâ€™s `MutableState`** for real-time UI updates, ensuring **efficient and reactive state handling** when adding and modifying shopping list items.  
- Applied **best practices in managing composable states**, allowing for a **fluid, dynamic, and scalable user experience**.  

### **Efficient User Input Handling & Validation**  
- Ensured **robust input validation**, allowing only **numeric values** for quantity while providing **real-time feedback** via `Toast` messages.  
- Optimized **focus management**, dismissing the keyboard automatically upon user action for a **smoother input experience**.  

### **Modular & Scalable Architecture**  
- Designed the project with **reusable composable functions**, making the **AlertDialog component adaptable** for different UI needs.  
- Utilized **utility functions (`isNumeric()`)** for input verification, ensuring **clean and maintainable code**.  
- Encouraged **separation of concerns** by structuring UI elements and logic efficiently, making the code **scalable and easy to integrate** into other applications.  

### **Technical Stack & Tools Used**  
âœ” **Kotlin** â€“ Core language for Android development, enabling clean, concise, and expressive code.  
âœ” **Jetpack Compose** â€“ Modern UI toolkit for declarative UI development.  
âœ” **Material 3** â€“ Implemented **the latest Android UI design guidelines**.  
âœ” **State Management** â€“ Leveraged `MutableState` for dynamic UI updates.  
âœ” **Android Architecture Best Practices** â€“ Used **composable modularization** to maintain **scalability, efficiency, and reusability**.
